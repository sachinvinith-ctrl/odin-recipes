# odin-recipes

I am going to create a recipe project in this repo named odin-recipes

Ill use HTML as the base to create this project and will employ HTML boiler-plate

In it it will contain extra tags such as links, images etc.

After i finish this project i could have completed my demonstration on how to create a website with bare HTML code and also push all my work with commits to the odin-recipes repo on github

so the skills i could be obtained from this will be git usage, HTML usage, tags usage and commit message usage (if i employ one)

time to get started.
