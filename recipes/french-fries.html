    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> French fries, our favorite side snack either with Mcdonald's burger, KF chicken, Fried rice or any recipe alike</p>
    <p> First invented in belgium from a family who would fry fish and eat but in winter fishes could not be had because of freezing there comes our fries</p>
    <p>if it is belgium invented then why it is named french fries? seems that belgium soldiers spoke french and when american soldiers encountered these in WWI</p>
    <p> they automatically assumed it was indeed called french fries</p>
