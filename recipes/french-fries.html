    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> French fries, our favorite side snack either with Mcdonald's burger, KF chicken, Fried rice or any recipe alike</p>
      <p> First invented in belgium from a family who would fry fish and eat but in winter fishes could not be had because of freezing there comes our fries</p>
      <p>if it is belgium invented then why it is named french fries? seems that belgium soldiers spoke french and when american soldiers encountered these in WWI</p>
      <p> they automatically assumed it was indeed called french fries</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
      </ul>

   <h3>Directions</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
       <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
       <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon</li>
       <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
       <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
       <li> Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
       <li> Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
