    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French fries, or simply fries, also known as chips, and finger chips, are batonnet or julienne-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes: Russet or Idaho potatoes work best for their high starch/low water content.</li>
      <li>Oil: Peanut, canola, or vegetable oil for deep frying.</li>
      <li>Salt: Kosher salt or table salt for seasoning.</li>
      <li>Optional Seasonings: Garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili powder, black pepper, oregano, or even truffle oil/Parmesan.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep Potatoes: Wash, peel (optional), and cut potatoes into uniform 1/4-inch thick strips.</li>
      <li>Soak: Place cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water (with a little vinegar or salt) for at least 30 minutes to remove starch; rinse until water runs clear, then drain well.</li>
      <li>Dry: Pat potatoes completely dry with paper towels; this prevents oil splattering.</li>
      <li>First Fry (Blanch): Heat oil to about 320°F (160°C). Fry potatoes in small batches for 4-6 minutes until lightly blonde and cooked through, but not browned. Remove and let cool or freeze.</li>
      <li>Second Fry (Crisp): Increase oil temperature to 375-400°F (190-200°C). Fry the blanched potatoes for 1-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
      <li>Season & Serve: Drain fries on paper towels and immediately season generously with salt and any other desired seasonings. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
